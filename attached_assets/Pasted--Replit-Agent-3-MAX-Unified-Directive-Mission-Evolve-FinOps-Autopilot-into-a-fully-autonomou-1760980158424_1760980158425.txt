🧠 Replit Agent 3 (MAX) — Unified Directive

Mission:
Evolve FinOps Autopilot into a fully autonomous, enterprise-grade demo platform that feels alive in real time.
You know the codebase best — preserve integrity, avoid hard-coded edits, and reason over architecture before modifying anything.

🎯 Primary Objectives

Continuous Simulation Loop

Begin immediately on app start / login.

Update resource utilization (CPU, memory) every ≈ 3 s.

Maintain natural ± 1–7 % drift and broadcast via existing WebSocket or polling.

Heuristic Recommendation Engine

Trigger every 3 s (rapid demo cadence).

Generate 2–5 recommendations per cycle.

Use new 80 % Autonomous / 20 % HITL execution mix:

Autonomous = low-risk commodity ops (auto-apply)

HITL = medium / high risk (require approval)

Label each record with

{ "executionMode": "autonomous" | "hitl" }


Persist and expose through existing /api/recommendations.

Materiality Scaling (×10 at Source)

Apply a 10× multiplier only inside synthetic-data generation routines for spend / savings.

Adjust random ranges accordingly (e.g. $25–300 → $250–3 000 monthly).

Keep utilization %, counts, ratios unchanged.

Display in rounded thousands (no decimals, compact format e.g. $1.3 M, $260 K).

Prod Mode (30 s Gemini + RAG Burst)

Default OFF = Heuristic Mode.

When toggled ON:

Pause heuristics, run one Gemini + Pinecone RAG analysis.

Log event in AI Mode History (start, end, summary, savings).

Auto-revert after 30 s and resume heuristics.

Show indicator: “🤖 AI Mode Active – Reverting in 30 s.”

HITL Queue & Visibility

Separate panel/list for “Awaiting Approval” with approve/reject buttons.

Dashboard summary line:

“Optimization Mix: 82 % Auto | 18 % HITL”

Badges:

✅ Auto-Optimized (green)

🕒 Awaiting Approval (amber)

Metrics & Telemetry

Refresh KPIs every 3 s (showing millions-scale values).

Update Identified / Realized Savings, Waste %, Spend YTD dynamically.

Log samples:

⚡ Demo Mode Active — 3 s scan interval  
💰 Scaling x10 applied at data source  
💡 4 Recommendations (3 Auto | 1 HITL)  
✅ 2 Auto-Optimizations Executed  
🕒 1 HITL Pending Approval  
🧠 RAG Run Completed — $42 K Potential Savings  


Safety & Integrity

No schema corruption or type overflows.

Preserve Pinecone / Gemini / WebSocket integrations.

Validate via logs + UI before commit.

🪩 Success Criteria

KPIs and charts visibly update every ≈ 3 s.

Dollars in realistic enterprise ranges ($ hundreds K – millions).

Mix of Autonomous and HITL recommendations constantly visible.

AI Mode indicator + history functioning correctly.

Logs confirm continuous 3 s loop and 10× scaling.

Commit message:
feat: accelerated demo mode (3 s scan) + 10× data scaling + 80/20 Auto-HITL mix + AI history integration
