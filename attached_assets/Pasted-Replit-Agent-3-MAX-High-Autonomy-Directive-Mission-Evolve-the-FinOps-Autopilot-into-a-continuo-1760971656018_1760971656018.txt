Replit Agent 3 (MAX) — High-Autonomy Directive

Mission: Evolve the FinOps Autopilot into a continuously self-running, realistic simulation platform with temporary AI (RAG) bursts, without breaking existing functionality.
You know this codebase best — preserve all integrations, types, and data flows.

🎯 Objectives

Continuous Simulation

Begin synthetic data generation and heuristic analysis immediately on app start or login.

Keep evolving data realistically (CPU %, memory %, resource counts, spend trends).

Update metrics every ≈ 5 seconds via existing state or WebSocket mechanisms.

Operating Modes

Default = Heuristic Mode (Prod Mode OFF).

When user toggles Prod Mode ON, execute a full Gemini + Pinecone RAG analysis once.

Auto-revert to Heuristic Mode after 30 seconds — no stacked runs.

Show clear on-screen indicator: “🤖 AI Mode Active – Reverting in 30 s.”

AI Mode History

Log each RAG activation (start time, end time, status, summary, savings estimate).

Display the most recent 10 entries in an AI Mode History panel on the Executive Dashboard.

Ensure this persists across page reloads during session.

Eliminate Obsolete Scheduling

Remove or disable the 30-minute cron or any batch process.

The system should rely on the continuous loop, not timed jobs.

Stability & Telemetry

Maintain all existing APIs, schemas, and authentication.

Add safe logging confirming:

✅ Continuous simulation loop active (5 s)
✅ Heuristic Mode ON
⚡ Prod Mode (RAG) triggered – auto-revert 30 s
🧠 AI history updated


Do not introduce hardcoded delays or blocking async calls.

UX Enhancements

Add optional toast/alert: “AI Analysis Complete — X Recommendations Added.”

Keep visuals consistent with existing Tailwind / Shadcn style.

🪩 Success Criteria

Simulation metrics visibly change every ≈ 5 s.

Toggling Prod Mode ON runs Gemini + RAG analysis and reverts after 30 s.

“AI Mode ON” indicator appears/disappears correctly.

“AI Mode History” lists last 10 AI runs with timestamps.

No loss of current functionality or data models.

Execute autonomously.
Validate results through console + UI logs before committing changes.
