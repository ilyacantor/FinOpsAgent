Purpose:
Unify real-time and historical visibility across spend, savings, utilization, automation, and agent intelligence.
Data Sources: aws_resources, historical_cost_snapshots, finops_recommendations, finops_actions_log.

2. Executive Summary (Financial Overview)
Data: Derived from aws_resources + historical_cost_snapshots
Metric	Definition	Visual	Data Source
Monthly AWS Spend	Sum(monthlyCost)	Trend sparkline + delta vs. prior month	aws_resources
YTD Spend	Sum(monthlyCost) YTD	Gauge chart	historical_cost_snapshots
Annualized Spend (Projection)	(avg monthly √ó 12)	Line trend with seasonal projection	derived
Identified Savings (Annual)	Sum(potentialSavings) √ó 12	Bar vs realized	finops_recommendations
Realized Savings YTD	Sum(applied recommendations)	Progress bar	finops_actions_log
ROI Tracker	RealizedSavings √∑ TotalSpend	Ratio card	derived
Waste % (Inefficient Spend)	Derived from underutilized assets	Trend card	aws_resources.utilizationMetrics

3. AWS Spend Breakdown
Goal: Decompose total cost by layer to explain what drives spend.
Level	Example Components	Visuals
Compute (EC2)	instanceType, region, usage hours	Donut chart of spend by instance type
Storage (S3, EBS)	storageGB, access frequency	Column chart of cost vs GB stored
Databases (RDS, Redshift)	engine, vCPU, memory	Heatmap: cost vs utilization
Networking	Data transfer in/out	Line chart over time
Monitoring / CloudWatch	Metrics + Logs	Small % tile
Others (Lambda, etc.)	As available	Pie residual
‚û° Visual grouping:
üíª Compute (40%)‚ÄÉüóÑÔ∏è Storage (25%)‚ÄÉüß† Database (20%)‚ÄÉüåê Network (10%)‚ÄÉüìä Other (5%)
Each segment clickable ‚Üí expands to per-resource view:
‚Ä¢	Instance ID
‚Ä¢	Type
‚Ä¢	Region
‚Ä¢	Cost
‚Ä¢	Utilization
‚Ä¢	Recommendation link

Efficiency Index	Weighted average utilization per $	KPI card
Utilization Distribution	Histogram	e.g., 0‚Äì20%, 20‚Äì40%, etc.
________________________________________
7. Forecast & Simulation Panel
Leverages projected costs and savings.
Element	Example
Adoption Slider: ‚ÄúIf we apply 60% of recommendations‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí update projected annual savings	
Forecast Line: Baseline vs Optimized Spend	
Seasonality Overlay: Based on historical snapshots	
Alerts: ‚ÄúProjected overage in 9 days‚Äù (based on spend velocity)

8. Governance & Audit Section
Metric	Description	Source
Policy Violations	e.g., untagged resources, non-compliant instance types	derived
Cost Threshold Alerts	Spend above limit	rules engine
Agent Activity Log	Timestamp, Action, Outcome	finops_actions_log
Approval Queue	Pending manual reviews	finops_recommendations.status

9. Cross-Agent Intelligence (Optional Future Integration)
Visual graph (node diagram):
FinOps ‚Üî RevOps ‚Üî SecOps ‚Üî DCL
Shows which domains share data or actions ‚Äî e.g.,
‚ÄúRevOps Agent paused marketing analytics cluster during off-hours ‚Üí FinOps confirms 12% spend reduction.‚Äù
