🧠 Replit Agent 3 (MAX) Directive — HITL vs Autonomous Optimization Visibility & Ratio Control

Mission:
Introduce explicit labeling and metrics for Autonomous vs HITL optimizations and maintain a target ratio of ~80 % autonomous : 20 % HITL for realism and optics.
Do not hard-code file paths — reason from the existing codebase and preserve data integrity.

🎯 Objectives

Classification & Tagging

Every recommendation must carry a field or flag:

{ "executionMode": "autonomous" | "hitl" }


Display this visibly in both dashboards:

Autonomous → green “Auto-Optimized” badge ✅

HITL → amber “Awaiting Approval” badge 🕒

Include a small summary line such as:

“8 auto-executed / 2 awaiting approval (last 10 optimizations)”

Ratio Control Logic

Default target ≈ 80 % autonomous : 20 % HITL.

Adjust risk assignment probabilities accordingly:

low risk ≈ 80 % → autonomous

medium/high risk ≈ 20 % → HITL

Allow slight random variation (±5 %) to look natural.

Dashboard Metrics

Add a compact widget or footer row:

Optimization Mix: 82 % Autonomous  |  18 % HITL


Update dynamically every 15 s with simulation refresh.

HITL Queue Display

List pending (HITL) items separately with “Approve / Reject” controls.

Approval instantly moves item to executed state and updates Realized Savings YTD.

Reporting / Telemetry

Extend AI Mode History and logs with summary counts:

Cycle 142 → 3 new recommendations (2 Auto, 1 HITL)


Ensure API endpoint /api/recommendations returns executionMode for each entry.

Safety

Preserve all existing heuristic/AI behaviors, timers, and storage.

Do not break Pinecone vector schema or DB migrations; add columns safely if missing.

🪩 Success Criteria

Each recommendation clearly labeled Autonomous or HITL in UI.

Mix ratio hovers around 80 / 20 over time.

“Optimization Mix” metric visible on dashboards.

Logs and history confirm both categories appear regularly.
